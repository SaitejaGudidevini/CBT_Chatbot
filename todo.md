Saitejas To DO list:

use these role names: 'user' 'assistant'

take out system prompt

leave in the 'user' saying something last (to give the idea that the user speaks again)

shorten how much the 'assistant' says-IMP

gemini suggested that the cbt_finetuning_dataset.json (with all steps) should work well - aka suggested that we don't need _little.json

make sure examples do have some variation (some can have other types of lead in conversation) - but save that for later...

consider some type of stop phrase...

make inference ask for the system prompt we'd like to test.

consider a quantization step:

Hugging Face Optimum Quanto Documentation: https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/quanto/overview 4

consider if we need to train on nvidia in case other notebooks have working chat trained examples
